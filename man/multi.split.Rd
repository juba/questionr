\usage{
multi.split(var, split.char = "/", mnames = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{var}{variable to split}

  \item{split.char}{character to split at}

  \item{mnames}{names to give to the produced variabels. If
  NULL, the name are computed from the original variable
  name and the answers.}

\value{
Returns a data frame.

\description{
Split a multiple choices variable in a series of binary
variables
}
\details{
This function takes as input a multiple choices variable
where choices are recorded as a string and separated with a
fixed character. For example, if the question is about the
favourite colors, answers could be "red/blue",
"red/green/yellow", etc. This function splits the variable
into as many variables as the number of different choices.
Each of these variables as a 1 or 0 value corresponding to
the choice of this answer. They are returned as a data
frame. ##'

\examples{
v <- c("red/blue","green","red/green","blue/red")
